## Background

'Satoshi Nakamoto' is the person/people/corporation/acronym attributed with being the inventor of the well-known digital currency/cryptocurrency Bitcoin. The original whitepaper for Bitcoin, titled 'Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System' was written and signed off by Satoshi Nakamoto on October 31st 2008. 

To this day it is unconfirmed who Satoshi Nakamoto really is. The first trace of Satoshi Nakamoto appeared on a P2P Foundation profile where he stated to be a man living in Japan, born on 5 April 1975. However, after some detailed research it proved quite unlikely that Satoshi was of Japanese descent due to his perfect English and his activity frequently correlating within times corresponding to daytime within Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), meaning that he was either a Japanese insomniac or that he in fact lived outside of Japan in a different time zone. 

## Who is Satoshi Nakamoto?

There are quite a number of people who are suspected to be the real Satoshi. One of the main suspects is Hal Finney, a pre-bitcoin cryptograpgic pioneer who was the first person (other than Satoshi) to test and use the Bitcoin blockchain software and to develop upon the first solution proposed by Satoshi. Finney had a Japanese-American neighbour named Dorian Nakamoto whose birth name was actually Satoshi Nakamoto, this has remained one of the main areas of speculation that has re-inforced peoples beliefs into the theory that Hal Finney was in fact the founder and creator of Bitcoin. Dorian himself is also highly suspected of being the real Satoshi, a trained Physicist who worked as a systems engineer and a computer engineer for financial services companies who was an avid libertarian.

Also tipped to be Satoshi is a cryptography graduate student from Trinity College Dublin, Michael Clear. Clear, now a post-doctoral student at Georgetown University was hired by Allied Irish Banks to improve its currency-trading software and also co-authored an academic paper on peer-to-peer technology. In 2011 Joshua Davis published an article in the New Yorker he narrowed down the search for Satoshi to several candidates, one of these being Michael Clear. However when asked if he was the founder, he stated "I'm not Satoshi, but even if I was I wouldn't tell you,".

## Digital Currency vs Digital Cash

The idea of having digital cash was not invented by Satoshi Nakamoto. In fact, it stems back all the way to 1983 when a research paper published by David Chaum introduced the idea of digital cash. He later went on to found DigiCash in 1990, an electronic cash company in Amsterdam to commercialize the ideas produced in his paper. However, the company filed for bankruptcy in 1998 and Chaum later left the company in 1999. 

Following on from DigiCash the likes of PayPal began to emerge in 1998. These provided quite a successful solution for taking physical cash to a digital medium and allowing users to send/move cash in various currencies around the globe. However, the currencies supported by these platforms were state backed currencies such as USD, GDP, EUR which were all controlled by central banks. 

This paved the way for Satoshi's new currency - Bitcoin. Bitcoin would develop to be the first fully decentralized digital currency with a fully open-source underlying technology and a public encrypted ledger allowing the world to transparently see the distribution and transfer of the wealth held by the anonymous people who owned some Bitcoin.
